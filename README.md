# Writing a Compiler in Go

Exercise source code from *Writing a Compiler in Go* by Thorsten Ball. This is an extension of my source code from the first book in this series, *Writing an Interpreter in Go*.

## Features

## Usage

To start the REPL and try the Monkey programming language out for yourself, navigate to the `src/monkey` directory and use:
```bash
make repl
```

This will build and compile the REPL and its supporting files.
